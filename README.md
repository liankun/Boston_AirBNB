## Description and Motivation
This is the first Project of second term of Data Science nano degree in Udacity.
I decide to analysis the data of AirBNB in Boston since this one seems a little challege.
The Questions I want to address is:
- For calendar : What are the busiest times of the year to visit Boston ?
- For listings : What is the main factor which affect the listing price ?
- For reviews: What are people's concerns in review ?

The answers I find is followings:
- December may be the busiest time of visting to Boston.
- The first four highest factors are :  accommodates, private room, position of the listing and cleaning fee.
- Most aspect people mentioned is hostself.
